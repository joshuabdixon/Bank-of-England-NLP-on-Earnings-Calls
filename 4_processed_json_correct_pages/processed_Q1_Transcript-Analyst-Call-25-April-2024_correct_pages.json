And then the second question is around cost. \u20ac20 billion of adjusted cost this year and stated at \u20ac20 billion next year to get to your cost-income target. There\u2019s a delta of around \u20ac600 million to \u20ac700 million.

        "Text": "Thank you, Kian, and thank you for your question. Also thank you very much for the shout-out to Fabrizio and Ram. I don\u2019t have to do it then anymore. And I even think that we took some market share from the US banks, not only from the European banks, if I think about the performance in the Investment Bank. Look, to your first question, let me tackle that, and James will then go on with the second question, and obviously with further comments to question number one. Let me start actually on the journey in 2024, because it really builds up nicely then to the 2025 story. It starts really with this good Q1, in my view across all businesses. And if we now look how the business is progressing, then you can really see that the stable businesses, i.e. the Corporate Bank, the Private Bank and Asset Management, that what we have seen in Q1 is actually a good number you can have in your mind also for the following quarters. And one item which is positive for us, and James can give you some further details, is that the NII is actually behaving even better than we thought and that what we have given you earlier this year. So, in this regard, there is less headwind on the NII side. And on the fee-generating side, we are actually succeeding there where we wanted to succeed and where the investments are now paying off. You have seen the market share gain in the Origination and Advisory business. We gained market share by 70 basis points. We have shown \u20ac500 million revenues in O&A this quarter. To be honest, it\u2019s a number which I would also see based on the mandates for Q2. Always hard to then go for Q3 and Q4. But with the investments we have done in people but also in Numis, I think that, again, Q1 is a very good marker in the O&A business. We have done, as you said, a very good job in the FIC business. That is far more diversified, far more stable, far more robust. And with all the rating upgrades we have seen, obviously it also helped to regain clients. And these are structural improvements where I would say this is, on the one hand, clearly supporting our market share gains but also telling us that these kind of businesses and flow business we are doing there is likely coming back also in the following quarters. So in a nutshell, if you take Q1 and you have the stability in the three businesses, in Asset Management, Private Bank and Corporate Bank, potentially even with some upside in Asset Management, and you see the strong pipeline we have in the O&A business and also the market position we have regained in the FIC business, I am more than confident that we can achieve the \u20ac30 billion just by adding up these four operating businesses, based on the starting point we have right now. If I then go into 2025, the first comment is that there is the tailwind on the NII side in the Private Bank. We have always talked about that. We have now, for quarters and quarters, gathered assets under management like in Q1, in PB and in Asset Management, and that obviously is driving further revenues there. So the NII tailwind and the benefits from the assets under management growth is driving further the Private Bank revenues in 2025 versus 2024. Then in the Corporate Bank, actually there is no NII headwind anymore in 2025 versus 2024, but we are benefiting from all the mandates which we are getting, actually, not only here in Germany, but globally. You have seen in the script how also in Q1 versus Q1 last year, we actually, increased our mandates which we won with multinational corporates. And that is again a momentum which I can see going forward. So a very stable revenue growth then in the Corporate Bank also next year. In the Investment Bank, to be honest, Kian, I absolutely further expect that we go to at least a 1% market share gain versus that what we had in 2023. We always said that with the investments which we have done, we want to gain 1% market share. We have done 0.7% in Q1, but there is more to come. And I also do believe that in particular, in the O&A market, there is a further recovery. We can see the momentum in the M&A market, in the ECM market. It is starting, but it\u2019s not there where I can see the fee pool is in 2025. And then obviously, when I go to the last point, in the Asset Management, also there, we will benefit obviously with the continuous inflow in assets under management. Looking at that, looking how we have started now Q1, looking at actually the better-than-expected NII trail and that the investments which we have done are paying off, I\u2019m not only confident in the \u20ac30 billion but then obviously, with the build-out in 2025, in the \u20ac32 billion.",

        "Text": "So Kian, on expenses, we talk a lot about run rate, monthly, quarterly run rates. We\u2019re obviously pleased that our focus on delivery achieved the \u20ac5 billion this quarter. We intend to continue that quarter after quarter over the course of this year and manage to an exit rate that puts us on track for our 2025 numbers. A couple of moving parts. So first of all, bank levy, we probably expect to book about \u20ac50 million this year. That might be about \u20ac150 million next year, but it depends very much on assumptions around what the SRB does, growth rates and deposits and the like. Then there\u2019s the non-operating costs. They\u2019ve run high for the past several years, but we are, we really think, at the tail end of the work we need to do in terms of restructuring and severance, the litigation profile that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. So I\u2019d love to see that in and around \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million in total next year, which would obviously imply an operating cost level in the high \u20ac19 billion. On a run-rate basis, that means we need to be taking expenses down by, say, \u20ac50 million to \u20ac100 million per quarter next year to achieve our numbers. You\u2019ve asked about easy wins. This is all hard work and focus and attention, execution. The starting point is really the delivery, we talk about \u20ac1.4 billion of actions that are achieved but not yet in the run rate. The run rate reflects \u20ac1 billion. So there\u2019s \u20ac400 million to come that\u2019s already executed, which in reality makes your difference in terms of the quarterly run rate. So in essence, we just need to crystallise the existing items. In reality, we\u2019re going to have some inflation, we\u2019re going to have some additional investments that take place, and we then need to offset those with the remaining actions underway, closing the gap between \u20ac1.4 billion and \u20ac2.5 billion, which is the total target. So the simple version of what\u2019s still to be done, it\u2019s still day-to-day execution on the glide path of those measures. Whether that\u2019s branch closures, app decommissioning, headcount reductions, process simplification, front-to-back on data, all of the things that we\u2019ve been talking about for some time now are on a glide path for delivery. And we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re set up to achieve the goals we laid out for this year and next.",

I guess your commercial real estate, the stress loss is unchanged, but what\u2019s the impact of rates staying higher for longer? Is there any pressure by the regulator to address commercial real estate exposure faster? And also, you mentioned a reversal of the backlog-related provisions in the Private Bank.

        "Text": "Thanks, Anke. So, look, the target that we\u2019ve been working to is really a January 1 target, with the Basel III impacts reflected, and a 200 basis points gap to MDA against that. So solve for 13.2% on January 1 with the \u20ac15 billion in it that we\u2019ve talked about. And really, what we have in the balance of the year is earnings less additional stock buybacks and the impact of business growth. And then from a model methodology, all that stuff, think of that as neutral. We\u2019re working through that capital optimisation to at least offset those pressures. Q1 is always a quarter where you\u2019ll see more burdens on the capital supply side, so I would not look at that as representative of the capital build that earnings can drive. And while Q1 is usually a high point in terms of organic capital generation, we\u2019ve had a pretty good track record of generating 25 to 30 basis points per quarter over the past several years. So that\u2019s the walk that we would outline to you. On the loan losses, we talk about three things that are running high in the first quarter, commercial real estate, which we expect to improve gradually over the year, the collections activity disruption that we expect to also correct and potentially see some recoveries in the second half, and equally, on the Wealth Management side, we\u2019ve had a series of cases over the years where we hoped, as we moved to workout, there may be recoveries there as well against an, I\u2019ll call it, underlying strong credit portfolio. So that reversion in the second half is one that, at least based on everything we see at the moment, we have good line of sight on. And so we\u2019d need to, in essence, compensate for every basis point above 30 today, we\u2019d need to compensate being below 30 in the second half. But we see the drivers that would drive us there. And lastly, commenting on part of your question, we\u2019ve had a very deep dive into the commercial real estate portfolio over the last four, five, six months, name by name, and feel comfortable that with the provisions we took in Q1, we reflect the risks that we see in that portfolio. We have, as we mentioned, seen the firming in our portfolio that\u2019s visible in some of the market pricing indices and what have you. While that is to some degree rate-dependent, we do think that we\u2019re seeing a floor and are optimistic, at least based on what we see, that that\u2019ll be preserved over the balance of the year.",

        "Text": "Thanks, Nicolas. So on the net interest income, I think magnitude, it\u2019s early in the year to say, but potentially considerable, in three-digit millions, easily in three-digit millions, put it that way. And the drivers are better deposit margins, better deposit volumes, firming loan margins, better funding costs, including unsecured, beta is still running behind, to some extent the interest curve that you see, the implied forward rates, although as you can also see in our materials, we\u2019ve hedged a lot of that. But the short answer is that all of those things, the drivers, are actually showing favourable compared to our planning, with the one exception that goes in the other direction of loan volumes. And there, obviously we\u2019d like to see a pick-up as the economy firms and demand rises. But all of those drivers are playing a role in giving us confidence in the outlook. Nicolas, on the buybacks, nothing changed from our target which we gave to the market before. We have clearly stated that shareholder value creation is the key priority for us. And hence, we are fully committed to the plans we have outlined to you, and that also means fully committed that we have a goal to actually distribute beyond the \u20ac8 billion which we gave you earlier. Now, with regard to timing, I think we are doing exactly that what we also said. We always said that we wanted to await Q1. We wanted to see that Q1 is running in line with our own plan, that we show operating leverage, that we show further increasing revenues, that we have costs under control. Exactly this has happened, and that gives us the confidence that we can now obviously also plan for the next steps and go into the discussions. But that is the discussion with the regulator, and this should be always respected. But as I said, we always said Q1 needs to be done. We are happy with Q1, and now we take the next steps.",

        "Text": "So Jeremy, the modification process, yes, I\u2019d say, in short, okay. We\u2019ve talked about this for a while. As we look at each individual property, we engage in the discussion with the sponsors on refinancing. Often, that includes terms, new equity, sometimes is concessions from the banks, and that\u2019s as it should be. I don\u2019t think of it as a giant extend-and-pretend process but a healthy process of managing these assets through a cycle. You should expect the modifications to continue to rise. But if this is a cycle that, as we think it is, is burning itself out, then the provision number as a percentage of that denominator should begin to decline, along with a gradual reduction in CLPs on a quarterly basis. And so that\u2019s what we would expect to see going forward. A lot of work still lies ahead, but so far, behaviour has been rational in light of valuations. On adjusted costs, that increase represents, if you like, the cumulative impact of the various investments we\u2019ve been making. We\u2019ve talked about investments in controls. We even talked about investments in technology, also the front-office investments we made last year, and now the run-rate impact of the Numis transaction as well, fully in the quarter. So that increase is there. Is it concerning? No, insofar as it was deliberate actions and targeted investments on our part. But as per the answer to Kian, now the work needs to be done to take that run rate back down modestly over the next seven quarters.",

So actually, our hope was that we would sound a little bit more confident on this call than in the prepared remarks on the net interest income. We are comfortable with the trajectory, but we\u2019re trying not to get too far over our skis on it. We think it\u2019s supportive of the trajectory to \u20ac30 billion this year and \u20ac32 billion next year. And to be honest, the way this will work, Chris, is the incremental NII that we expected to get in 2025 would be compared to the higher base in 2024 so that it would essentially just add, because of the factors that I outlined being the drivers. So short version, this is incremental in 2024 and carries over to 2025. The numbers, that doughnut in the appendix, that does move over time, there\u2019s no question. It\u2019s depending on the mix shift in the market environment generally. We think we\u2019ve got a healthy portfolio mix in our, what I\u2019ll call FIC markets, we\u2019re describing here as FIC ex-Financing. But it\u2019s driven by macro and micro trends, client positioning. It\u2019s driven by the extent to which structured transactions are happening in any one of those product areas. So it does move around, but we think of it as a healthy portfolio mix.",

I think your annualised growth in Wealth Management and Private Banking is running at around 8%, annualised, from that new money.

Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re doing there, what geographies are driving this, whether there are particular products or any other unique selling points that are explaining this? And a related question. One investor alerted me to a story on his media platform this morning which suggested that FINMA is looking at your Wealth Management business in Switzerland. Is there anything to flag there, or is there just nothing further?",

        "Text": "Thank you for your questions. Let me start, and James will amend. Look, on the FINMA side, we gave a clear statement that there is no restriction. And secondly, obviously I hope you respect it that we are not going more into details when it comes to regulatory discussions, but we have said everything in writing. So for us, we can onboard clients. Number two, with regard to Wealth Management and the Private Bank, yes, actually since Claudio has been with us, it has been always our focus actually to go more into the investment businesses, by the way, not only in Wealth Management but also in the Private Bank. We see that as a clear growth area and, in particular, as a clear long-term growth area. So I think I said it before on these calls. If you think about what is one of the real sticky items also here in Germany going forward, it is what happens with the pensions of our retail clients. And the focus Claudio is giving to the investment businesses, where obviously we have an expertise which not a lot of other banks, in particular, in the home market have, is something which is now helping us a lot. It also helps us, by the way, that we got all the rating upgrades, that we have a completely different reputation in the market, and the investments Claudio did in Wealth Management outside Germany, in parts of European countries, in particular, in Asia, you know that we invested heavily in the Middle East, are now all paying off. And therefore, yes, we are happy with the growth, but it\u2019s part of the two- to three-year story and strategy which Claudio built. Now, as we see the success, in particular in Wealth Management, as I said, we want to bring it more and more into the more Private Bank and Retail Bank business, because there is actually the need for the clients. And therefore, I expect actually that we do see these kind of growth rates also going forward, which is again supporting that what I said in the first question from Kian. One should not underestimate the continuous growth in revenues actually in those businesses from the continuous accumulation of assets under management, in particular, in this business. So a clear focus of Deutsche Bank.",

You\u2019ve had a lot of inflows, and yet your revenues in the first quarter haven\u2019t really moved much. So if I look at your guidance in the division, it would seem you\u2019re expecting quite a bit of a pick-up over the next nine months. So I suppose, what is driving that relative to the first quarter? And then, secondly, just looking at the Financing revenues, where you put a really helpful slide in there, in the pack, look, it\u2019s been a major source of growth for you but also your peers. I\u2019m just curious about what\u2019s driving that kind of growth differential versus pre-COVID levels and how sustainable that is. Because I suppose, if I look at the leverage consumption of the IB, it\u2019s gone up considerably over the last four years. So maybe if you could provide a sense of the margins of that business or the capital intensity, that would also be great.",

        "Text": "So Tom, the way you think about fee and commission income in the Private Bank is it\u2019s a client business volume measure. And Christian referred to it as sticky. So as we build balances, we build activity. We\u2019ve seen a year-on-year growth rate of 2%, but now at a level in the first quarter that significantly exceeds any quarter last year, especially the second, third and fourth. And so we think that that\u2019s going to continue to build on itself and create more and more year-on-year differential. There is some amount that obviously depends on clients\u2019 investment activity, trading activity, if you like, in any given quarter. But, call it, the stable revenue base that we\u2019re seeing in the Private Bank and fee and commission income growth is very encouraging and I think is set to continue. I think in terms of your question about resources in the FIC business, we\u2019ve been very focused on that consistently over the years. We tend to look at it in terms of revenue production related to RWA. As you can see, market risk RWA, relatively modest for us, so it is principally credit risk RWA, both in the balance sheet and derivative businesses. But we think we\u2019ve got some of the best in the business at understanding and optimising that. And the same is true of leverage exposure, where we manage to the constraints of our balance sheet but work to optimise how we deploy that leverage exposure to support clients as well as the revenue profile. Sometimes, by the way, the business you do is leverage exposure-intensive but not RWA-intensive, and sometimes the opposite. And hence, the optimisation efforts that we go to there are considerable and sophisticated. So I would stop there. I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything.",

        "Text": "Thanks, Andrew. So \u20ac8 million is the number this quarter on FDIC. By some quirk of accounting, we can\u2019t characterise it as bank levies, so we don\u2019t call it out separately. But it also means, if I look at the net going into this quarter\u2019s run rate, actually there\u2019s probably more things pushing it up than pushing it down, of which FDIC was one. In C&O there\u2019s always some degree of volatility. V&T was a feature this year, certainly year on year. In the quarter, it was relatively more neutral but reflected really changes in the interest rate curve, by the way, some of which we would expect to get back in the balance of the year through pull to par. Always hard to say, therefore, what the pre-tax profit impact is going to be. We talk in the guidance about what the shareholder expense is that we expect, what the incremental, call it, run rate or annual Treasury funding costs are. So for modelling purposes, I would go with a quarterly version of that annual guidance and accept that there is some volatility in valuation and timing. Incidentally, we\u2019ve been working over the years to reduce and minimise that volatility to the extent we can. So lots of work\u2019s gone into hedge accounting programmes and other things to both manage the risks, the balance sheet risks that we have but do so in a way that is as accounting-neutral as we can. And we\u2019ve made some good progress in that regard.",
