And then what should give us the confidence that the loan losses can come down in Q4 and 2025? You show us slide 13. Should the Postbank integration and the large corporate events almost drop out, or drop out in 2025? And when you gave us 2024 guidance, and we've been looking, sorry to say, but at two quarters of upward revision, what did you underestimate when you previously guided for 2024?",

And I think the full year guidance, you have implied it will be again about that level in Q4. When I look at slide 32, and it's useful, thank you very much for putting in that slide, I see you've locked a significant part of the hedge income already for the next two years. So that's very reassuring. I also see that you've used a ten-year swap that would be 2.3% to 2.5%. And that makes sense based on today's curve. But the risk here is rather to the downside. So the question here is also, the light blue column, the contribution from the rollover of the hedges, if the ten-year swap would go towards, say, 2% or 2.2%, would we still see the rollover contribute positively in the next two years on top of what you've locked already?",

I think you were saying before, James, that to make your guidance for 2025 cost, you would need to get adjusted cost quarterly run rate down towards \u20ac4.9 billion. Now, obviously, you\u2019ve just had three quarters in a row where you've met the guidance for this year at \u20ac5.0 billion. So maybe could you talk a little bit into the capacity for you to get there already in Q4, and what gives you the confidence that you can get towards the \u20ac4.9 billion quarterly run rate for adjusted cost next year?",

I think you're implying that that's the new run rate, we stay around that level going forward. And I guess it's a positive really that your modified loans are now \u20ac13 billion out of the \u20ac15 billion. So it implies you've worked your way through pretty much the whole portfolio. And I guess that supports that outlook. So first question is really just, are we now expecting to go forward at that \u20ac68-million-ish run rate?",

The industrial logic makes sense, but you're just not ready right now. And I just wondered how you view the scenario of someone like Commerzbank tying up with a different bank and effectively becoming unavailable. What remaining optionality would you have? Where else would you see opportunities for consolidation and for Deutsche Bank to play a leading role?",
