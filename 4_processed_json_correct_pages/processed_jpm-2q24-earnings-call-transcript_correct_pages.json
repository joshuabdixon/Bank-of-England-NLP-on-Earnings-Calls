As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?",

And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed.",

        "Text": "Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds.",

By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens.",

So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's \u2013 we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point.",

So, in no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one.",

I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not \u2013 we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic.

That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing-related sort of matchbook repo-type stuff and similar things that are \u2013 gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore, quite low RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak.",
