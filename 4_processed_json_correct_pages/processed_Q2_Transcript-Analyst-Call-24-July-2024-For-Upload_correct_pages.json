In your remarks, Christian, you talked about the \u20ac4.9 billion run rate, potentially at the end of the year. And I just wanted to see how you think about the flexibility that that offers next year, to get to your cost income guidance. If you can talk maybe around is there flexibility to run below \u20ac20 billion, in that sense, considering you are indicating a lower number for the end of the year, even if it's adjusted versus stated? And how that thinking is around, and confidence is around the cost income guidance.",
