And also, help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio, range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the higher-end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's – we have to wait for Basel III Endgame re-proposal to come through and all that, but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules?",

For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here. But, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20 plus years has been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here. And so, you're asking a pertinent question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the far more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it, that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.",
