The momentum, the development in all four businesses, feedback from clients. In all the last three or four years we not only met our revenue targets, but even exceeded that in the years. It really makes me confident that from the offering we have, from the positioning we have, it is actually the right starting point also for the next years.

We did on purpose the investments in the middle of 2023, not only Numis, but in particular, also the hirings of senior directors in the corporate finance business.

Look, I do believe that James and I have always managed this bank in a prudent and conservative way, i.e., in particular to your question, €1 billion to €750 million. First of all, I'm really happy with the starting point with which we start into this measurement year of 2025. 13.8% capital ratio gives us the ammunition, on the one hand, to grow business and have the right resources. That's all in our plans. But at the same time, obviously also reward our shareholders with the €750 million, which we announced. And we should not forget that with the 50% increase in dividend per share, we announced to the market already a distribution of €2.1 billion for this year. I think it's a wonderful starting point. If you move that up, we are now at €5.4 billion distributions since 2022. If we think about our path which we gave to the market, in particular with regard to growing our distributions and also the dividends, and you apply the next increase on the dividends for next year, you are already very, very close to the €8 billion.",

We think that the operating leverage that we've built and will continue to see in the company will take the cost/income ratio further down in the years to come. We absolutely think that that is within reach of the firm, but not in 2025. That then gets you to what has driven the adjusted costs up to our current view of €20.3 billion on the old FX. Look, it's a bunch of drivers. And again, cumulatively since the last capital markets day, I would probably bucket it as a third, a third, a third. It's €600 million or €700 million over that time if you express it in cost/income ratio terms. And about a third has gone into business investments, about a third into controls, and the further third into technology, if I give you rough numbers. Probably a little bit more weighted towards technology in that math.",

And we would stick with the estimate of around €7.5 billion of impact in RWA from January 1st, 2026. I think there's a decent likelihood it'll be delayed just because I think we all believe, and so does some of the legislators, that that creating a competitive disadvantage for the European banks in this area, waiting until FRTB implementation comes to the United States and UK would be unnecessarily damaging. And hence, we do think that's an opportunity. And at a point in time where it's more certain, it can enter into our capital trajectory and thinking. I would add that there are some other potential changes in our requirements going forward that can impact, say, MDA.",

And that, therefore, drives our views on the level of CET1 that we need to run at with an appropriate buffer against that. And, of course, the 13.8% is a good place to be in that regard. There will be some changes, as we talked about, FRTB denominator impact, but also potentially some changes in MDA. One example would be our O-SII positioning.
